
Vanilla JS Algorithm that takes an image and scans it 
for pixelator and creates a color and brightness map that
represents the image.

When we get the pixel data, we delete the image and create
a particle system and we take these particles and make
them flow on the canvas.


It can be used as an intro or logo or animated background, etc

Some browsers do not like it when you analyze pizels of images,
you can convert the image to URL so it will be part of the JS file.
You can use JS for convertion, but to be faster you can use
an online converter!
